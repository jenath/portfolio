                <p>
                    I am a passionate engineer, with a love for sport, board games, music and food.
                    I have 3 years of experience working as a developer and have worked in small teams as well as large organsiations.
                    My current skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Jest and Python. I am looking to develop my skills as an engineer and
                    contribute to more challenging projects. This web application is to share some more details about me and projects I have worked on along side my CV.
                    I currently represent the Middlesex County for badminton and run badminton club sessions in my local area.
